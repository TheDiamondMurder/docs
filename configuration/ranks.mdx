Managing ranks is a core feature of BloxPro, it is how you configure the bot to your server's group ranks.

First of all, when you are starting, you will need to initialise the ranks from the group into the database.

```
/rank init
```

This copies all your ranks from your group and puts them in your discord server ready to be configured.

Any time you make any changes to the ranks in your Roblox group, you will need to update them with a **different** command

```
/rank update
```

In comparison to the init command, this command just checks the differences between your database and the roblox group, and makes the required changes.

You can then view a rank or all your ranks

```
/rank view (Rank ID)
```

## Rank Configuration

To configure your ranks in the group, you can use these commands

```
/rank lock [rank ids]
```

Allows you to lock one or more ranks from auto promotion. Players cannot be auto promoted to that rank by a bot if it is locked.

```
/rank unlock [rank ids]
```

Exact same as the previous command, it just unlocks it instead.

```
/rank xp [rank id] [xp]
```

This sets the minumum XP required for a rank. If the user has more XP than this they will be promoted to this rank

```
/rank addmedal [rank id] [medal id]
```

Bind's a medal to a rank, if a user gets to this rank, they will recieve a medal (they will only recieve this medal once)

```
/rank removemedal [rank id] [medal id]
```

This will remove a ranks medal.

```
/rank prefix [rank id] (prefix)
```

This will add a prefix to rank, this prefix will be given to a users nickname when they do /getroles. You can remove a prefix by leaving the prefix input empty

<Info>
  You must set up your nickname format correctly for the prefix to be displayed
</Info>

To bind your ranks to a discord role, you can add roles to the rank

```
/rank addrole [Rank ID] [@Role]
```

Then you can remove roles from ranks

```
/rank removerole [Rank ID] [@Role]
```
