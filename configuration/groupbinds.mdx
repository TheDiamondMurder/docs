You can add roles that will be assigned to users if they are in a given group. You can bind as many Roblox groups to as many roles as you want.&#x20;

```
/groupbinds add [Group ID] [@Role]
```

You can then view all your group binds in your discord server

```
/groupbinds view
```

To delete a group bind

```
/groupbinds delete [Group ID] [@Role]
```

Users will receive any roles for the groups they are part in when they run `/getroles`or when someone does `/update`on them
