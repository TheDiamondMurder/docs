You can configure your general server settings with the **/settings** command.

```
/settings view
```

This shows you your current settings and what they are set to.

```
/settings autonickname [true/false]
```

This enables/disables Auto Nickname. Enabling it means the bot will change members nicknames to the given format when they do /getroles

```
/settings audit (channel)
```

This command sets a channel to be the audit log channel of the server. If you want to disable it, just leave it blank without putting in a channel.

```
/settings nickname [nickname format]
```

This command sets the nickname format for the discord server. You can view the placeholders available with **/settings nicknameformats**

```
/settings xpname [name]
```

This changes the XP name for the server, allowing you to have more customisation control.
