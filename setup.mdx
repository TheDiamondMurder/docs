Once the bot is in your discord server and you have verified, you will need to grab your Group ID, this can be achieved by grabbing your Roblox Group's URL, which will contain your group id.

<Warning>
  You need to be the Group Owner & Server Owner in order to setup the bot with the discord server.
</Warning>

Once you have your ID, go into **your server** and run **/setup \[group id]** After that, agree to the Terms of Service and then your group will be linked to the database.

Once that has all finished you will be added to the queue to have the bot added to your group. You can check the status of the bot being added by doing **/queue**

<Info>
  It may take up to 48 hours to get the bot into your group, if it takes longer, please open a support ticket.

After that you are all good to go. Welcome to BloxPro
