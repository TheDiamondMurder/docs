Hey there BloxPro users, the first few months of BloxPro has been amazing to all of us to see the support we have received from groups. We are still in the phases of ironing out bugs, but there will be far less in the coming future, and because of your help we were able to identify those annoying bugs.

Enough about that, Update 1.1 is the first update of BloxPro and I want to talk more about it and introduce what we are adding to BloxPro's first ever update

## Whats new?

### New Booking System

We are adding a system that allows admins to create booking types (example: Training, Interviews ect) and then the assigned roles can host those bookings by creating slots. Users then will be able to book that slot.

### Training System

We are adding depth to the qualification system that already exists. If a user completes X amount of trainings, they can unlock a certain qualification. Assigned roles can host these trainings and then the host will mark the attendance. Training data can be seen in `/profile`

### Probation Ranks

Probation ranks will be ranks that you can set as probation ranks that will not let a user progress past it just by having enough XP, this means that a user will have to manually be promoted with commands by staff to get past this rank

We are extremely excited to bring this Update to you and to your community and we can't wait to see how you implement it into your groups.

Thank you,\
Diamond\
Founder of BloxPro
