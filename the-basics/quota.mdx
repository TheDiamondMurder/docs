The quota system is where you give certain roles a certain amounts of quota points they have to have in a given time period. This system can be used to make sure that your staff are active, and you can give them quota points if they attend events for example. To set a minimum requirement for quota points for a rank:

```
/rank quotapoints [rankid] [points]
```

You also need to enable the quota for that rank

```
/rank quota [rankid] [True/False]
```

After that, you need to define how long everyone has to accumulate the quota points

```
/quotaconfig changeperiod [Quota Length in Days]
```

Once thats done, you are all set, to give users quota points:

```
/quotaconfig add [username] [amount]
```

They can then check their quota, or you can check theirs

```
/quota (username)
```

After the quota time is up, you can then do a quota check, to see who has completed it and who hasn't

```
/quotaconfig quotacheck
```

After you have completed the quota check, you can then reset it, which will restart the time period you specified and clear everyones quota points

```
/quotaconfig reset
```
