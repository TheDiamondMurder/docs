If you want to have users with nicknames that match their rank & Roblox account

E.g: [O6] JoelHCraft

This is how you would do it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto Nickname">
    You can enable AutoNicknames with the following command

    ```
    /settings autonickname true
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a Username Format">
    Set a username format to whatever you want it to be with these placeholders:

    **{roblox_username}** Their Roblox Username\
    **{roblox_nickname}** Their Roblox Display Name\
    **{discord_name}** Their Discord Name\
    **{rank_prefix}** Their Roblox Rank's prefix

    You can set that with the following command

    ```
    /settings nickname [Format]
    ```

    An example format: {rank_prefix} {roblox_username}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Rank Prefix">
    Add a Rank Prefix to a Rank

    ```
    /rank prefix [Rank ID] (prefix)
    ```

    To remove the prefix from that rank, just leave the prefix input blank
  </Step>
</Steps>

After that, a user should be able to run **/getroles** and recieve their new nickname

<Warning>
  Make sure that the BloxPro bot has permissions to change nicknames
</Warning>

<Danger>
  BloxPro cannot change the Server Owner's nickname
