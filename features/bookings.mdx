The Booking system allows users to book predefined events created by admins (known as booking types), and allows certain roles to host them.

To create a booking type, the role defines what role can host this booking

```
/bookingconfig create [Name] [Description] [@Role]
```

You can view all booking types created

```
/bookingconfig view
```

To host a booking type, you need to have the defined role to host it

```
/booking create [Booking Type ID] [Day] [Month] [Year] [Hour] (Roles) (Spaces)
```

Booking Type ID is the ID of the booking type you want to host

Day, Month, Year, Hour is the time and date the booking will happen.

You can add roles which can attend this booking or leave blank for everyone

Spaces is how many people can book the event

You can then manage that booking
