Qualifications are items that a member can hold to say they are qualified for something. You can make this anything you want and then assign players to it, and even set the qualification expiry date.

```
/qualification create [Name] [Description [Emoji Icon]

This will create a Qualification that you can then assign to users

```
/qualifications assign [Username] [Qualification ID] (Valid for)
