You can blacklist users from your group, this will prevent them from being able to be promoted or assigned XP

```
/blacklist create [Type] [Username/Group ID] [Reason]
```

Type: User or Group

Group blacklists work the same, they just do that for anyone in a certain group.

To remove a blacklist

```
/blacklist remove [Type] [Username/Group ID]
```
